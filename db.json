      "description" : "Nanatsu no Taizai, honestly I think this is one of the great action shows of the past few seasons. This was a manga adaptation that had a goal in mind as to where it wanted to finish in the source material and it did everything it had to in order to get there. Normally this can lead to some questionable adaptations (like say Deadman Wonderland), but in this case it worked out fine. Any changes made compared to the source material in my view were minor while they still managed to hit the key points in spectacular fashion. In terms of adaptations I’d consider this a pretty strong one.At its core Nanatsu no Taizai is an action show. But an interesting twist is that instead of the main cast starting out as wimps and having to spend a whole show training or something….the cast starts out pretty awesome. In some ways they gain strength, but in others they really don’t and it’s more dealing with the situations they are presented with. With this show it’s not as simple as saying one side is stronger because they have more energy or something. There is a mix of physical strength, special abilities and magics that really decide who might come out on top in a confrontation. The first episodes start off showing how damn strong the main cast are and giving some context for when the stronger characters for their opposition start to crop up. I just found it rather refreshing that we didn’t have to wait 20 episodes to start seeing characters do something impressive.",
